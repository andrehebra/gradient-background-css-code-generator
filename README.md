# gradient-background-css-code-generator
A website that let's you pick a gradient and preview it, with a label at the bottom to copy the CSS code for anyone to use.

This is just a simple website that I made to help people create gradients for their websites. It's also the first thing that I've ever put on github, so if it sucks whatever I'm still proud of it.
